    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Julia Siqueira. I am a junior studying Anthropology as a major. I might add a minor in Digital Studies if I don't completely suck at this class. But luckily, this class is going well so far! I'm also taking DIG101 and it has been really interesting so far.
        </p>

    <h2>My Prior Experience</h2>
        <p>All of my web-design experience stemmed from a required project in freshman Humanities called 
            the portfolio using WordPress. I knew a bit about WordPress by the end, so I decided to take a 
            risk and take a job managing DemsofDavidson.org. I learned even more doing that 
            (with a lot of WP help from my sister) and then got an internship at Ada Jenkins building a site that connects 
            underserved individuals with resources to help them financially.</p>

    <h2>Why I'm Taking This Class</h2>
        <p>The sites you've just looked at (hopefully) show my progression of basic web-design knowledge. 
           I can tell that I've learned a lot since starting last year, with the help of WordPress editors 
           like Elementor. But Elementor only offers me a tiny degree of control with their static 
           list of features. I want things to look and behave the way I want them to, which is why 
           I need to learn things like HTML and CSS. It's the most annoying thing ever when Elementor 
           won't let me move a button exactly where it needs to be, or when the padding looks stupid, etc.
