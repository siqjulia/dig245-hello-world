    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Julia Siqueira. I am a junior studying Anthropology as a major. I might add a minor
        in Digital Studies if I don't completely suck at this class. But luckily, this class is going well so far!
        I'm also taking DIG101 and it has been really interesting so far.
    </p>

    <h2>My Prior Experience</h2>
    <p>All of my web-design experience stemmed from a required project in freshman Humanities called
        the portfolio using WordPress. I knew a bit about WordPress by the end, so I decided to take a
        risk and take a job managing DemsofDavidson.org. I learned even more doing that
        (with a lot of WP help from my sister) and then got an internship at Ada Jenkins building a site that connects
        underserved individuals with resources to help them financially.</p>

    <h2>Why I'm Taking This Class</h2>
    <p>The sites you've just looked at (hopefully) show my progression of basic web-design knowledge.
        I can tell that I've learned a lot since starting last year, with the help of WordPress editors
        like Elementor. But Elementor only offers me a tiny degree of control with their static
        list of features. I want things to look and behave the way I want them to, which is why
        I need to learn things like HTML and CSS. It's the most annoying thing ever when Elementor
        won't let me move a button exactly where it needs to be, or when the padding looks stupid, etc.
        Other than that, I do not know how to code. The last time I took a coding class was a required
        programming class in high school using code.org that got interrupted by COVID.
    </p>

    <h3>Learn Computing</h3>
    <p>I chose the API tutorial. APIs, or Application Program Interfaces, deliver data between clients and servers.
        Individual users who use apps or google things put in requests called "gets" on some type of graphical user
        interface
        or GUI. Then, the app or the site asks the server for information and then delivers it back to them through
        "posts".
        Lots of businesses make free, public APIs to encourage engagement from 3rd parties. People can access the
        endpoints, or
        a URL where you can find it. The presentation mentioned Spotify's endpoints, which reminded me of this app my
        friends
        and I use called airbuds which lets you see what music your friends are listening to in real time. It must use
        Spotify and Apple Music API endpoints.
    </p>

    <h3>Remarkable Digital Projects</h3>
    <p><a href="https://direkris.itch.io/you-are-jeff-bezos" target="_blank"> You Are Jeff Bezos </a>: I liked this
        project because it shows how unethical it is to be a billionare.
        I solved like every issue there was to solve and still had more money.
    </p>

    <p><a href="https://alexagate.com/" target="_blank"> Alexa Gate</a>: This project made me think about how stupid it
        is to live in a world where someone
        might actually buy a piece of plastic to prevent being spied on instead of just getting
        rid of the thing that's syping.

    <p><a href="https://www.molleindustria.org/flash/index.html?file=/swf/phone_story_web.swf" target="_blank"> Phone
            Story </a>: This game is a
        good reminder of how we all use unethical technology and we pay thousands for an iPhone but the people who make
        it make nothing.
